1. IRLS

	1) d1_logli function: Calculate the first derivative of log-likelihood of Bernoulli distribution with logit link.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: beta
		written in Rcpp-Armadillo.
		Not used in any function.
	
	2) logli function: Calculate the log-likelihood of Bernoulli distribution with logit link.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: beta
		written in Rcpp-Armadillo.
	
	3) beta_calculator: Update beta by IRLS.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: beta
		written in Rcpp-Armadillo
		The equation is included in "IRLS_equations" file
	
	4) optim_irls: Loop the optimization process.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: Initial beta,
			logL: initial value of log-likelihood, eps, tolerance, maxit
		written in R
		The convergence criteria is the relative change of log-likelihood
		output: beta estimates, Log-likelihood at beta estimates, iteration, eps at termination
		

2. problems I encountered
	1) n is large, so when creating diag(w) matrix, memory allocating error showed up.
		I used X.each_col() to avoid this issue. And it was faster as well.
	2) When calculating inverse matrix, the speed of SVD decomposition and inv fuction in RcppArmadillo are almost the same when p=38.
